Question -> Difference between inheritance and polymorphism.

⭐ Inheritance :

    -> The Class acquires the property of parent class it's called "Inheritance."

    -> Types of inheritance:
        1) Single Inheritance
        2) Multiple Inheritance
        3) Multi Level Inheritance
        4) Hybrid Inheritance
        5) Hierarchical Inheritance
       Note: Multiple Inheritance is not supported by Dart, but we archive with the using of Interface.

    -> purpose of inheritance is "Code re-usability."

    -> we can inherit the parent class using "extend" keyword.


⭐ Polymorphism :

    -> The word Polymorphism has been derived from greek words "Poly" and "Morph." where Poly means Many
       and Morph means Form.

    -> Polymorphism means an object has different form, and each different form performs the same
       action/task in different/multiple ways.

    -> Polymorphism is generally used to access private variables and methods.

    -> Types of Polymorphism:

        1) Method Overloading: The method who has the same name but different parameters in the same
                               class it's called "Method Overloading."

        2) Method Overriding: The method who has the same name and the same parameters but in different
                              class it's called "Method Overriding."

        Note: Method Overloading is not supported by Dart.
