Question -> Which inheritance is not supported by Dart? Why? What is advantage of inheritance?

-> In Dart, Multiple Inheritance is not supported

-> because, the same variable name and same method name in parent class is confusing the compiler.

-> suppose class C is inherit class A,B. The class A and B has one same method name "print_data()". when
   we call print_data() method though object of class C the compiler will confuse class A method called or
   class B method called.

-> but, We can achieve multiple inheritance using interface.

‚≠ê Advantages of inheritance :-

    Code Reusability :- Inheritance allows a new class to reuse the properties and methods of an
                        existing class, reducing code duplication.
