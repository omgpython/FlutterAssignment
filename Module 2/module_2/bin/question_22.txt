Question -> Which inheritance is not supported by Dart? Why? What is advantage of inheritance?

-> In Dart, multiple inheritance is not supported. This restriction is in place to avoid the
   complexities and ambiguities that arise from multiple inheritance, such as the "diamond problem",
   where a class can inherit the same method or property from multiple base classes, leading to potential
   conflicts and confusion.

-> but, We can achieve multiple inheritance using interface.

‚≠ê Advantages of inheritance :-

    1. Code Reusability
    2. Extensibility
    3. Polymorphism
    4. Hierarchy and Organization

    1) Code Reusability :- Inheritance allows a new class to reuse the properties and methods of an
                           existing class, reducing code duplication.

    2) Extensibility :-  By inheriting from a base class, new functionality can be added to existing
                         code without modifying it, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

    3) Polymorphism :-  Inheritance supports polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be
                        treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables the writing of more
                        generic and reusable code.

    4) Hierarchy and Organization :-  Inheritance provides a natural way to organize classes into a
                                      hierarchy, making the system easier to understand and manage.
