Question -> Difference between inheritance and encapsulation. Difference between inheritance and abstraction.

⭐ Inheritance :

    -> The Class acquires the property of parent class it's called "Inheritance."

    -> Types of inheritance:
        1) Single Inheritance
        2) Multiple Inheritance
        3) Multi Level Inheritance
        4) Hybrid Inheritance
        5) Hierarchical Inheritance
       Note: Multiple Inheritance is not supported by Dart, but we archive with the using of Interface.

    -> purpose of inheritance is "Code re-usability."

    -> we can inherit the parent class using "extend" keyword.
