Question -> Can we pass an object of a subclass to a method expecting an object of the super class? Are static members inherited to subclasses?

-> We can access all methods and members of superclass using object of subclass.
-> This archived using 'extends' keyword.

-> Static member cannot inherit to subclass. Because it's class-level member.
